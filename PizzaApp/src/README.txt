This project was a mobile application that was coded in Java and built using Android Studio. It was a project that I worked 
on with a classmate that simulated ordering a pizza online. When the app runs, the user is greeted with a screen where they 
can choose one of three options of pizza flavors. Once the user selects a flavor, another screen will open and it will allow 
the user to pick a size (small, medium or large) and add or remove pizza toppings for their order. As the user changes which 
size or which toppings theyâ€™d like their pizza order to have, the price of the order listed at the bottom of the screen 
increases or decreases based on what is selected. In order to code this portion of the project, I created four different 
activities which is the name that Android Studio uses to describe the window in which user interface activity takes place. 
The first activity was the opening screen for the user where they could choose what flavor they would like. 
The second activity was where the user could specify which toppings they would like to add or remove from their order and 
what size they would like their order to be. The third activity was where the user could see the total, subtotal and tax for 
their pizza and decide if they wanted to move forward with their order or not. Lastly, the fourth activity was where every order 
that has been submitted via the application was listed.
