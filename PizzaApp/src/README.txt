Pizza Application

This project was a mobile application that was coded in Java and built using Android Studio. It was a project that I worked on with a classmate that simulated ordering a pizza online. 

 This project was developed using four activities:
1. The first activity was the opening screen for the user where they could choose what flavor they would like. 
2. The second activity was where the user could specify which toppings they would like to add or remove from their order and what size they would like their order to be. 
3. The third activity was where the user could see the total, subtotal and tax for their pizza and decide if they wanted to move forward with their order or not. 
4. Lastly, the fourth activity was where every order that has been submitted via the application was listed.
