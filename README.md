# Camryn-Harrell-Projects
This code represents mostly projects that I have created on my own with the exception of HeartTransplant.java which is a school project.

GoogleSearch--> this code creates a class called Google and uses the class, Article, to match any articles within the article class with a title that has been entered into the program. The Google class has the option printing out any articles based on any keywords.

TutoringMatch--> this code takes in a group of tutors that is inputed by the user. The tutor object has the following attributes: name, subject and rating. The Tutor class has methods that will return the most appropriate tutor for the user based on either the subject they need help with, the rating that they prefer or both.

AirbnbUser Match--> this code takes in a group of Airbnb hosts. It has two classes: Airbnb (which takes on the user) and Accounts (which takes on the hosts). The Airbnb and Account objects have the following attributes: name, area and budget. The methods in Accounts use those attributes to return the appropriate matches based on either area, budget or both.

Movie-App --> an app that allows the user to choose from a variety of movies and add certain films that they like in particular to a "favorites" category. (From a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc9_Bqzy2YQ&t=2020s)

2048 --> mock of the 2048 app, also from a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDn2g8XfSMc)
